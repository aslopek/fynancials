/**
 * The two decisions made about a URL a renderer hands to the main process: whether the operating system may be asked
 * to open it, and whether the window may navigate to it.
 *
 * Both are default-deny, and both exist because the URLs in question are not this app's own strings. A renderer
 * displays what a database, an HTTP response or a user typed, so a link's target is data - and a URL handed to the
 * shell is opened by whatever the OS has registered for its scheme, which for `file:` is "run this". A navigation is
 * the same problem one level up: a window that leaves its own document keeps the preload's bridge, so the page it
 * lands on inherits every IPC channel this app exposes.
 *
 * Anything unparsable is refused rather than guessed at, which is what makes these two total functions over strings.

 * The schemes the OS may be asked to open. Deliberately short: a browser is the only intended target, and every
 * scheme beyond these two - `file:`, `javascript:`, `smb:`, and the OS-specific handlers that come and go - is a way
 * to reach something other than a browser.
