 * - a missing file is a true first run - there is nothing to continue with, and finishing the setup is the only way
 *   forward;
 * - an unreadable file could not be turned into a configuration at all, so continuing would mean continuing with
 *   defaults the user never chose;
 * - a config naming no database has nothing to continue *to*.
 *
 * However, an existing `databasePath` does not imply a usable database file exists at that location. So a successful
 * start cannot be guaranteed.
